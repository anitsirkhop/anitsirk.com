				<h2>I'm Kristina. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/0pXdS" target="_blank">Buffalo, New York</a> born. Lover of all things design. Passionate about digital publishing and letterpress printing. A sucker for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_terminal" target="_blank">ball terminal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_serif" target="_blank">slab serif</a> typefaces. Longing to live where it snows too much in the winter and at the beach the rest of the year (I know...it's a little backwards!) I live in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uo2M2" target="_blank">York, Pennsylvania</a>, never far away from my iPad chock-full of digital magazine, an ever-growing library of graphic design books and magazines.</h2>

				<h3>I've been a graphic designer since 2010 and have ganed valuable experience working in design and communications environments within associations, family-owned businesses and Fortune 500 corporations. I currently specialize in the design of print and digital publications and sales marketing materials and have an interest in working in branding and gaining more experience in web design &amp; front-end web development.</h3>

				<p>Some other info about me:</p>

					<li>Pinterest-aholic <em>(seriously, how have I pinned over 22k things?!)</em> I'm always seeking inspiration to bake/cook/craft/plan/make/dream a myriad of <a href="http://instagram.com/p/gHojeSODFW/" target="_blank">bragging-rights earning</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/duQ-ETODIR/" target="_blank">bacon-y</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ZmZUZvuDH7/" target="_blank">not-so-awesome</a> things!</li>
					<li>Tech geek/early adopter. I've been known to stay up way past bedtime the first night of an iOS release so I can have it on my iPhone the next morning <em>(why wait 2 days when it'll take all of 10 minutes to do?!)</em> Those weird Oreo and Doritos flavors at the grocery store? Yep, I buy those!</li>
